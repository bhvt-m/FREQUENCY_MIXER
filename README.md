# Frequency Mixer: Beauty and the Blur

## Overview
This project demonstrates image frequency domain analysis and hybrid image construction using 2D Fourier Transform and filtering techniques.

## Contents
- **_Frequency_Mixer.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook with step-by-step code for importing images, performing FFT, applying Gaussian LPF/HPF, and merging.
- **REPORT_ON_Frequency_Mixer.pdf**: Detailed lab report with explanations, theory, results, and analysis.
- **result_images/**: Contains result images (FFT magnitude spectra, hybrid images, etc.) for reference.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `PIL`, `scipy`
- Optional: Google Colab for seamless execution

## Running the Notebook
1. Open `Q1_Frequency_Mixer.ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
2. Upload your `cat` and `dog` grayscale images when prompted.
3. Follow the cells to compute and visualize the frequency domain analysis and hybrid image.

## Results
See `result_images/` for key plots and the `REPORT_ON_Frequency_Mixer.pdf` for detailed explanations.
